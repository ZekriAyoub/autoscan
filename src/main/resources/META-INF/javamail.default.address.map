# File added to prevent the warning:
# "expected resource not found: /META-INF/javamail.default.address.map"
#
# This file is optional and only used for specific custom address mappings
# in JavaMail (e.g., non-standard address types).
# It is not used in our ScanMyCar project, but its presence suppresses the warning message.

# No address mapping is required for our ScanMyCar application
